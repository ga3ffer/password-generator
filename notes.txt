-	Pw are still the most commonly used mechanism for user authentication in most computer systems.  
-	Alternative methods such as challenge-response, public-key, and biometrics are not very popular at the moment, and are often times combined with passwords.  
- 	user is often the weakest link because they choose easily guessed pw
-	security
		guarantess the password contains a specific amount of entropy
		entropy measures the unpredictability of a choice
		the ps word is choosen from a very large set of passwords
			entropy: characterset^pwlength
				character set:83 pwlength: 4 = 83^4 = 47458321 = 2^26
				bits of entropy log2(x) or ln(x)/ln(2)
	noramlly users create passwords with common words combines with a number
	confidentiality
		many people use the same pw for multiple accounts, if a weak website is compromised the attacker can gain access to other accounts of the user.
		increase the security by forcing the use of unique pw for diff accounts, still the risk of the use adopting the same pw for other accounts which defeats the purpose
	usability concerns
		user created pw are easier to remember
-	high security systems use random generated passwords
